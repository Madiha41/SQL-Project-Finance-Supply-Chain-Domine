# Finance and Supply Chain Analysis - AtliQ Hardware

## Overview
AtliQ Hardware is a leading global manufacturing company specializing in electronic peripherals such as mice, keyboards, and other devices. The company operates through three primary distribution channels: retail partnerships, direct channels (AtliQ Exclusive stores and e-Stores), and distributors in regulated regions like China and South Korea. This strategy allows AtliQ to maintain a robust global presence across both traditional and digital platforms.
